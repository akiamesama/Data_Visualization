The folder is for generating data

1. Please run generateCSV.py to generate the csv file from <SourceData> and <groupinfo>. It also generates the neo4j_script automatically.

2. After runing the generateCSV.py, we got the neo4j_script. Then please run the script in the shell, which load data into our database.



In conclusion, we need to run 2 programs here:
1. python generateCSV.py 
2. ./neo4j-shell --file /Users/Scarlett/Desktop/eBusiness/Practicum/generateData/neo4j_script
#(Please make sure you are in the right directory to run the conresponding file)


If we edit it using ubuntu:
sudo bash /var/lib/neo4j/bin/neo4j-shell  --file neo4j_script
